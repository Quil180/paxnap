 pax_fra_exhibition.1.d:0 "It’s been 23 years since Napoleon’s great victory at the Battle of the Nations in October of 1813 where the French decisively defeated the Sixth Coalition. Napoleon later exploited his victory at Leipzig during the Coalition’s scattered retreat, defeating nearly every Coalition army separately. The British however, escaped through Prussian ports. April 1814 became the defining period of the war, french victories and the enactment of extended conscription for Coalition forces led to revolutionary ideas to start flaring up in the Germanic nations of Austria and Prussia. Eventually leading to the Austrian people's revolt of 1814 on the 24th of April, the Austrian monarchy survived this thanks to a French intervention with the diplomatic aid of Napoleon’s wife Mary Louise, Austria responded by signing a conditional surrender with Napoleon. Prussia also seeked a separate peace deal during this period in order to sort out their own issues at home, and ensure they did not endure their own revolt. Many smaller nations also seeked separate peace deals during this unstable period, such as Sweden, Spain, Sardinia and a number of small German states; many of them becoming protectorates. Great Britain and Russia were now Napoleon's only real threat. In May of 1815 Napoleon launched his second invasion of Russia with over one million troops from all over europe. With the Russians getting exhausted of the war and British support fading Tsar Alexander signed a peace with Napoleon, rejoining the continental system and Russian land concessions were the terms of this agreement."
